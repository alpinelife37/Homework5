Simple day planner that displays the current day, allows user to input events by hour and save to local storage after pushing the "save button." Information stored will retain in the fields after re-fresh or until updated with a new value.

Day planner consists of three files, the main index.html, a moment.js file, and a script.js file; plus the readme.md file.
